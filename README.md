## React.js Memory Game

This is a memory card game built using React. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Users click on one of the 12 images, and attempt to click as many images in a row as they can without clicking on the same image twice. Their top score is recorded and the game restarts if they click on the same image twice within a given game.

## Technologies and Methods Used

React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, game logic

## Challenges and Learning Summary

I previously taught myself React but had not dealt with incorporating game logic into an application. I decided to keep the application simple since it's not robust, so created one component which houses the card data, game logic, and score keeping.
